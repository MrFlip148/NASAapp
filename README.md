# NASAapp
test app connecting to the NASA image api

###### What we expect to see (minimum)
* ~~Using more than one API endpoint~~
* ~~At least three different views~~
* Full screen image viewing
* ~~Possibility to view metadata~~
* ~~Some sorting and/or filtering options for the items~~
* Using a proper build script (and tools). (Please write instructions on how to build).
* Mobile first (or only) design
* A well structured project with code and resources divided into folders and files. E.g. the code for each view should be contained in separate files (one or more per view).
